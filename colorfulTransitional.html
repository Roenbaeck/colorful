		<br/><br/>

		Transitional Modeling aims to capture the ongoings of real life events in a 
		simple but powerful format, while minimizing information loss as such events
		are recorded. At its core it talks about things and the multifaceted situations 
		these things appear in. Things are represented by <em>unique identifiers</em>, 
		such as <thing>42</thing> and <thing>89</thing>. When a thing
		appears in a situation it does so by taking on <em>roles</em>, such as
		<role>loves</role> and <role>beloved</role>. It is 
		necessary that anyone who has an opinion about the situation agree upon 
		which unique identifiers correspond to which things and the meaning of the 
		roles. This necessary agreement ensures that whatever unique identifiers and roles 
		represent are interpreted equally for every involved party regardless of when, 
		where, or how interpretations are made.
		<br/><br/>

		Together, identifiers and roles can be used to form <em>appearances</em>:
		<appearance>(42, loves)</appearance> and <appearance>(89, beloved)</appearance>.
		Technically, an appearance is an ordered pair, consisting of an identifier for a thing 
		and a role this thing has appeared or will appear through. From the example it can be determined 
		that the thing represented by <thing>42</thing> has at some point appeared as one who 
		<role>loves</role> something and <thing>89</thing> as a thing 
		<role>beloved</role>. Given this, it is still undetermined who <thing>42</thing>
		<role>loves</role> and by whom <thing>89</thing> is <role>beloved</role>.
		In order to relate the things to each other an <em>appearance set</em> is needed, such as  
		<set>{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}</set>. Only then can we know that 
		<thing>42</thing> <role>loves</role> <thing>89</thing> and that 
		<thing>89</thing> is the <role>beloved</role> of <thing>42</thing>. 
		When a thing appears to have a certain property, rather than 
		a relationship to other things, the appearance set will only contain one appearane, such as 
		<appearance>(42, has name)</appearance>. An appearance set has one or more appearances as members and it provides the base upon 
		which we can bestow a value.  
		<br/><br/>


		While <thing>42</thing> and <thing>89</thing> have become forever and uniquely bound to the things they represent, 
		experience tells us that <role>loves</role> and <role>beloved</role> may be transitional states. An accurate
		description needs to qualify or quantify the relationship using an <em>appearing value</em>, such as <value>actively felt</value>, and
		an <em>appearance time</em>, such as <time>2009-09-21</time>, indicating since when this value has been in effect. 
		All together these form a <em>posit</em>:
		<div class="centered">
			<posit>[{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}, "actively felt", '2009-09-21']</posit>
		</div>
		A posit binds an appearance set to an appearaing value at an appearance time. We now know that 
		<thing>42</thing> <role>loves</role> <thing>89</thing>, <thing>89</thing> is the <role>beloved</role> of <thing>42</thing>, and it is <value>actively felt</value> since 
		<time>2009-09-21</time>. However, such knowledge relies on every posit being confidently and unquestionably true. It is therefore 
		frail knowledge, since it fails to capture the inherently uncertain and conflicted nature of information. Anything built upon frail knowledge 
		may come down crashing when reality makes itself heard and the gaps prove unfillable. 
		<br/><br/>

		The solution is to 
		explicitly make it possible to express doubt and disagreement about posits, instead of assuming them to be 
		confidently and unquestionably true.
		Let us assume that <thing>89</thing> thinks it very likely that <thing>42</thing> <role>loves</role> 
		<thing>89</thing> since <time>2009-09-21</time>, and that this thought was 
		expressed on <time>2018-02-13</time>. As we may want to prevent individuals from contradicting themselves, the
		certainty they express towards a posit must be put into numbers, and more specifically into the [&ndash;1, 1] interval. This will 
		provide us with the capability to mathematically decude if contradictions exist. So, let the notion of "very likely" correspond
		to a <em>certainty</em> in the interval <value>0.7 &ndash; 0.8</value>. This is no exact science, which is why an 
		imprecise value in the form of an interval is used. Regular values may also be imprecise, 
		so there needs to be a presumed agreement among the involved parties with respect to reliabilities and values. 
		If two individuals both talk about <value>actively felt</value> we will presume they share an equal interpretation, 
		even if the value itself implicitly expresses some degree of imprecision. Similar reasoning apply to points in time, which 
		are by their very nature impossible to capture with infinite precision.
		<br/><br/>

		Given that we now know how <thing>89</thing> expressed themselves, with respect to an existing or at the time of 
		expression newly created posit, an <em>assertion</em> can be formed, such as:
		<div class="centered">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><thing>555</thing></td>
					<td><posit>[{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}, "actively felt", '2009-09-21']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (555, posit)}, "0.7 &ndash; 0.8", '2018-02-13']</posit></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		An assertion is in itself a posit, using the two <em>reserved</em> roles <role>ascertains</role> and <role>posit</role>.
		In order for <thing>89</thing> to express an opinion about a posit, the posit must also be associated with a unqiue 
		identfier, here <thing>555</thing>. Assertions are <em>meta-posits</em>, and they provide additional context to a posit 
		in the form of how certain some thing deems it to be at some point in time. The appearance time of an assertion is 
		also called <em>assertion time</em>.
		<br/><br/>

		Thinking about it some more, <thing>89</thing> became completely certain of the posit. Reconsideration can be captured through 
		a new assertion, with a later assertion time, here <time>2018-08-20</time>.
		<div class="centered">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><thing>555</thing></td>
					<td><posit>[{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}, "actively felt", '2009-09-21']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (555, posit)}, "0.7 &ndash; 0.8", '2018-02-13']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (555, posit)}, "1", '2018-08-20']</posit></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		Certainty is also transient, people change their minds all the time. That this is indeed a <em>change</em> can be determined 
		by the fact that: two posits have the same appearance set but different values at different appearance times. The assertion 
		in effect is different depending on what time it is. 
		<br/><br/>

		Just like the assertion in effect can change, so can the original posit. 
		<div class="centered">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><thing>555</thing></td>
					<td><posit>[{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}, "actively felt", '2009-09-21']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><thing>556</thing></td>
					<td><posit>[{(42, loves), (89, beloved)}, "felt no longer", '2011-11-11']</posit></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>		
		Since this posit is different it will be associated with a new unique identfier. This posit indicates a change, but given
		that we still haven't seen any assertions, we do not know if this is actually how <thing>42</thing> and <thing>89</thing>
		feels. They express their opinions of the new posit <thing>556</thing> in the following assertions.
		<div class="centered">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(42, ascertains), (556, posit)}, "-1", '2018-08-20']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (556, posit)}, "1", '2018-08-20']</posit></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		While <thing>89</thing> is certain of the posit, <thing>42</thing> is certain it's not the case. This is an example of 
		a concurrent disagreement between the two <em>asserters</em>. Perhaps <thing>89</thing> fell out of love, while 
		<thing>42</thing> did not.
		<br/><br/>

		People do err sometimes though. Not long after, <thing>89</thing> realizes their mistake and needs to somehow mend 
		the whole situation, and expresses the following.
		<div class="centered">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (556, posit)}, "0", '2018-09-22']</posit></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td><posit>[{(89, ascertains), (555, posit)}, "1", '2018-09-22']</posit></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		The first assertion has a certainty of 0, complete uncertainty, also known as a <em>retraction</em>. Since <time>2018-09-22</time>
		<thing>89</thing> has no opinion at all about the posit <thing>556</thing>. Instead, <thing>89</thing> restates their
		opinion towards <thing>555</thing>. A posit is a <em>restatement</em> if for the same appearance set, the value is the same as
		in the immediately preceding posit with respect to their appearance times. 
		<br/><br/>

		To summarize, posits are statements that are opinionated through assertions, where the assertions themselves are also expressed
		as posits. Certainty ranges from being certain something is completely inaccurate to it being completely accurate, with 
		complete uncertainty midway between, which is the same as having no opinion at all. Information may change over time, where
		a change is identified by two posits with the same appearance set, but different values at different times. 
		<br/><br/>

		If a body of information was to be expressed using Transitional modeling, or in other words, with posits, the following types
		of searches could be performed:
		<br/>
		<br/> ✔︎ Search anywhere for the unique identifier <thing>42</thing>, NVP Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search apperances for the <role>beloved</role> role, Graph Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for every time <appearance>(89, beloved)</appearance>, Graph Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for when <role>beloved</role> is <value>actively felt</value>, Relational Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for information as it was on <time>2009-09-21</time>, Temporal Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for information given what we knew at <time>2018-02-13</time>, Bi-Temporal Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search assertions for disagreements between <thing>42</thing> and <thing>89</thing>, Multi-tenant Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for information that is at least <value>0.75</value> reliable, Probabalistic Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for corrections made between <time>2009-09-21</time> and <time>2018-02-13</time>, Audit Database-like search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for how many times consensus on a posit has been reached, new feature search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for how many times opposite opinions have been expressed, new feature search.
		<br/> ✔︎ Search for individuals that have expressed themselves contradictory, new feature search.
